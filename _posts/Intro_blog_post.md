<h1> Hi I'm John</h1>


<p> This being my 1st post, I thought I would talk about 1) how annoyed I am that the game between my Texas Rangers & the New York Yankees is on a 2 hour rain delay in the 9th inning! I meean come on, I know its wet
but there are only 2-5 outs left in the game. So at 12:17am i thought I should talk about subject #2.<br><br>

<p> What I will talk about 2nd is the how engaging learning web development has become. When I was a teen I wanted to be a profetional starcraft player, and would get so engaged in what I was doing that I lost 
entire days without noticing it. Working on some of these projects with Bloc is getting the same level of mental engagement(altho im now 30 with 3 kids, so losing an entire day to programming is not an option) and it's
very cool that I get that level of mental engagment, becuase it signals to me that this is a field of work I can get completly wrapped up in.</p>

<p> Oh well, that's my introduction post, im to tired to absorbe more lessons, but I do have to decide if I am going to try and wait for the baseball game to finish or go to bed, im leaning hard on waiting for the game
